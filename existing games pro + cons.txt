Monkeys with guns
Good

-Crates drop down from the sky and u can shoot and stand on the crate :O (cool mech)
-Has spikes that come kill u after certain time (makes more interesting)
-Cool skins for monkeys
-Gun goes back to normal after running out of ammo
-There is health so players get to skirmish slightly longerâ€¦
-Everything you shoot and interact with has nice animations + sounds
-Every level has different mechanics :O

Bad
-Not much stuff to learn, need something to master
-Controls could be a lot more responsive
-If a party game, need to give noobs a more balanced way to get ahead?

-Weapon is super satisfying to use
-Everything is really satisfying to do

Bad
